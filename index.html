    <div class="text">
      <h2>Model 1</h2>
      <p>
        This is the first model. You can add a longer description here explaining
        its purpose, features, or story. The text and the model share the same
        section background.
      </p>
    </div>
    <canvas id="modelCanvas1"></canvas>
  </section>

  <section class="model-section">
    <div class="text">
      <h2>Model 2</h2>
      <p>
        Here is the second model with its description. The layout adapts so the
        model is shown on the right side, and the description on the left.
      </p>
    </div>
    <canvas id="modelCanvas2"></canvas>
  </section>

  <section class="model-section">
    <div class="text">
      <h2>Model 3</h2>
      <p>
        Finally, this is the third model. Again, you can expand this paragraph
        with any explanation you want. The background alternates between light
        grey and light blue to keep things visually distinct.
      </p>

    <canvas id="modelCanvas3"></canvas>
